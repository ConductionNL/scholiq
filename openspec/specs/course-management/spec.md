# Course Management

## Why
Course Management ranks #2 of 354 canonical features (153 demand, 43 tenders, 12 competitors). All 13 OSS LMS leaders ship it; the differentiator is a modern Vue/NL-Design surface — insight #16 says "OSS LMS leaders all share dated UX". Without authoring, Scholiq cannot anchor the LVS, eLearning, training, and certification surfaces above it.

## What
Authoring of courses, modules, and lessons; cloning of templates; ordered learning paths; published-vs-draft state; ECTS workload declaration for HE; programme-committee approval workflow for HE catalog changes; Open Onderwijs API publication so external sites and student portals consume one source. Content runtime is cmi5 + xAPI primary, with a SCORM 1.2/2004 shim for legacy packages.

## User Stories
- As an HE administrator, I want the course catalog exposed via Open Onderwijs API so external apps and the institution website pull from one source.
- As a board member, I want catalog changes to go through programme committee approval so curriculum governance is auditable.
- As an administrator, I want each module to declare ECTS workload so totals match the 60-credit-per-year Bologna rule.
- As a student, I want the catalog to tell me up-front whether I meet a course prerequisite so I do not waste time on a denied registration.
- As an instructional designer, I want to clone a published course as a draft so I can prepare next year's edition without breaking the live one.

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN an instructional designer opens a published course, WHEN they click "Clone for next year", THEN a draft copy is created with a new academic year tag and zero enrolments.
- GIVEN a student opens the catalog, WHEN a course has unmet prerequisites, THEN the enrol button is disabled and the failing prerequisite is named in plain text.
- GIVEN a programme committee approves a catalog change, WHEN approval is recorded, THEN the change becomes visible in OOAPI within 5 minutes.
- GIVEN an HE administrator queries `/ooapi/v5/courses`, WHEN the request authenticates, THEN the response complies with OOAPI 5.0 and includes ECTS, language, and level fields.

## Requirements
- The system MUST support Course → Module → Lesson hierarchy persisted as OpenRegister objects.
- The system MUST publish the course catalog via OOAPI 5.0 endpoints.
- The system MUST run cmi5 + xAPI content natively and SHOULD provide a SCORM 1.2/2004 compatibility shim.

## Standards
SCORM, xAPI, cmi5, LTI 1.3, Common Cartridge, NL LOM, VDEX, OAI-PMH, OOAPI 5.0, Schema.org `Course` / `CourseInstance`, ECTS, Bologna.

## Data Model
See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Uses entities: `Course`, `Module`, `Lesson`, `LearningPath`, `Prerequisite`, `CatalogChangeRequest`. All persisted via OpenRegister; no Scholiq tables.

## Out of Scope
- Authoring tool for SCORM packages themselves (use external authoring; we run, not author).
- Real-time collaborative lesson editing (V2).
- Marketplace / paid course storefront (separate spec if pursued).
